# 🚧 MOD Code Jam Challenge: BIM Context Graph + Agentic Assistant

Welcome to the MOD AI Code Jam! This is a collaborative and creative challenge where we'll prototype a core subsystem for MOD’s future Contextual GNN — with an agentic twist.

---

## 🧠 Goal

Build a modular pipeline that:

1. **Parses a BIM model from IFC format**
2. **Extracts contextual relationships (e.g., adjacency, containment, connectivity)**
3. **Constructs a graph abstraction (nodes + edges + attributes)**
4. **Wraps this into a lightweight agent** that responds to user prompts like:
   > “Build a graph with only load-bearing walls and adjacent doors.”

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters

MOD’s roadmap includes a **Contextual GNN Model (Q4 2025)** that interprets spatial logic in BIM models to support prefab validation and optimization. This challenge kicks off that direction.

You’ll also simulate how this capability would be embedded in a **LangGraph-style agent**, part of MOD’s broader AI-native architecture.

---

## 👥 Team Roles

- **Mohaymen & Meng Ju**:  
  Lead BIM logic, define geometry extraction from IFC using tools like `ifcopenshell`.

- **João & Jorge**:  
  Lead graph extraction logic, feature engineering, and agent construction.

- **Yashar**:  
  Facilitate system modularity, ensure extensibility, and connect the work to MOD's GNN and mod-val/mod-rec future.

## 🔧 Tasks Overview

### 1. Parse IFC Model

- Use `ifcopenshell` (Python) to extract relevant spatial elements from a provided `.ifc` file
- Transform those elements into structured JSON (e.g., rooms, walls, doors with metadata)

### 2. Build Context Graph

- Nodes: prefab-suitable elements (e.g., rooms, walls, doors)
- Edges: spatial/semantic relationships
  - `adjacent_to`
  - `contained_in`
  - `connected_to`
- Attributes: type, dimensions, load-bearing status, etc.
- Output: Graph object (e.g., NetworkX) + JSON

### 3. Add Agentic Wrapper

Build a lightweight agent that:

- Accepts natural-language prompts
- Parses intent (e.g., which types of nodes/edges to include)
- Filters input and calls the graph builder
- Returns:
  - Graph (JSON or visualization)
  - Short explanation (e.g., “Graph has 6 nodes, 3 adjacency edges.”)

*Bonus*: Use GPT for prompt parsing or post-hoc explanation.

## 🚀 Let’s Build the First MOD Graph Tool!

This challenge is an entry point into the graph abstraction layer that will power MOD's contextual reasoning, validation, and prefab recommendations. It's also a test of how domain expertise, geometric logic, and AI orchestration come together.

Make it modular. Make it explainable. And have fun with it!
